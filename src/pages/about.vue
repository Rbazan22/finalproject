    <h2 class="text-6xl tracking-tighter font-extralight py-4">Who are we?</h2>
    <p class="px-4 text-center">
      We began in a small rural community in South Texas as a group of 4 kids
      with a brilliant goal. A goal that seemed far-fetched at the time for us;
      to create a car wash service for the community! Back in 2003, us 4
      (Rodrigo, Eliud, Lalo, Alex) brainstormed how we could afford to begin
      such a business and where could it lead in the future. We asked ourselves
      questions such as "Can this idea really turn into a long-lasting
      business?", "Will this business produce enough income for the 4 of us?",
      and "How will we come up with enough money to originally fund the idea?".

      Plan of Action
    </h2>
    <p class="px-4 text-center">
      All 4 of us began working minimum wage jobs in order to gather enough
      money to buy a plot of land suitable for our service; a busy part of town,
      if you will. Once the plot of land was successfully owned by us, we
      continued working during that entire summer in order to achieve enough
      money to start the entire project. Months later, we started the project
      with flexibility in mind, and wanted to make sure we had a fall-back in
      case anything went wrong. Sure enough, the building process started taking
      place and about 9 months later the building was complete; however there
      was one problem, we were still missing the products! We got to work and
      used our months of product research to use. Once acquired, we opened for
      business in 2005!
