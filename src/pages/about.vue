    <p class="px-4 text-center">
      We began in a small rural community in South Texas as a group of 4 kids
      with a brilliant goal. A goal that seemed far-fetched at the time for us;
      to create a car wash service for the community! Back in 2003, us 4
      (Rodrigo, Eliud, Lalo, Alex) brainstormed how we could afford to begin
      such a business and where could it lead in the future. We asked ourselves
      questions such as "Can this idea really turn into a long-lasting
      business?", "Will this business produce enough income for the 4 of us?",
      and "How will we come up with enough money to originally fund the idea?".

      Plan of Action
    </h2>
    <p class="px-4 text-center">
      All 4 of us began working minimum wage jobs in order to gather enough
      money to buy a plot of land suitable for our service; a busy part of town,
      if you will.
